time complexity - map

storing 
fetching

log(N) - best, average, worst

unordered_map

storing
fetching

O(1) - average, best
O(N) - worst

hashing - division method - linear chaning, done using linkedlist
          folding method
          mid squared method

collision - whatever hash happens it ends up at the same key (hash index)
