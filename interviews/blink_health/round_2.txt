Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet exists.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The triplet (3, 4, 5) is valid because nums[3] == 0 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.


Given a circular array arr[] of N integers such that the last element of the given array is adjacent to the first element of the array, the task is to print the Next Greater Element in this circular array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as “-1”


Input: arr[] = {5, 6, 7} 
Output: {6, 7, -1} 
Explanation: 
Next Greater Element for 5 is 6, for 6 is 7, and for 7 is -1 as we don’t have any element greater than itself so its -1.

Input: arr[] = {4, -2, 5, 8} 
Output: {5, 5, 8, -1} 
Explanation: 
Next Greater Element for 4 is 5, for -2 its 5, for 5 is 8, and for 8 is -1 as we don’t have any element greater than itself so its -1, and for 3 its 4. 


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
